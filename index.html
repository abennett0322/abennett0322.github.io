			I am a 26y/o guy currently living in San Antonio, Texas. I am married to my high school sweetheart, have a border collie named Whiskey, and recently became a proud father to a baby boy.

                        My passion for technology began early on when I took my first computer science class as a freshman in high school. After that I continued computer sicence for 2 more years until my senior year where I decided to focus on music instead. I was a percussionist in band, and at the time I thought that's what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. When I went off to college, I quickly gave up my future with music to pursue a future as an entrepenur. I enrolled in the College of Business and had my sights set on majoring in Marketing. After 3painful years of struggling through business my grades dropped drastically and I was kicked from school. It was at that lowest point of not knowing what to do anymore that I rediscovered my passion for programming. I enrolled in the College of Sciences, redescovered my passion for programming, and the rest is history.

                    </p>
                    <p>
			I currently work remotely as a ServiceNow Developer/Consultant at Highmetric building custom applications for business and organizations.
                        <!--I currently work as a Software Engineer Intern at Booz Allen Hamilton, working with artists and other developers to make interactive learning courseware. Through my internship I have learned to work in an agile environment and develop games with Unity3D and WebGl. In my spare time, I enjoy learning new web frameworks through various solo projects, and staying up to date on the latest technologies. Though my current internship is mostly game development, I want to pursue a career as a Full Stack Web Developer.-->

                <h4>Software Engineer Intern</h4>
                <p>
                    I like to consider this my first "Grown up" job. Being a computer science student, I am finally able to put my studies to use, begin my path down my career field, and follow my passion. As an intern, I learned to apply my technical knowledge to assist clients with the development and integration of new technologies with an application development focus. Working with Unity3D and WebGL, I assisted in the development of interactive learning ranging from HTML5 EBooks, to virtual reality simulated environments.

                <h3>TopGolf</h3>
                <h4>BayHost</h4>
                <p>
                    When I was hired at TopGolf, I was just another college student looking for a way to fill my gas tank and fund my video game addiction. I had only a few things on my mind: I'm poor. I've never been a server. What the heck is TopGolf? Well, after working there for a little over a year, I can proudly admit I'm now a pro golfer... at least I like to think I am. I learned a lot from working as a server at TopGolf. Gained valuable people skills, like guest interaction and public communication, as most people do when they are servers. However I also learned how to make work fun and how to dance ("wobble") it off when times gets tough.

                <h4>Assistant Manager</h4>
                <p>
                    The worst part of working at a movie theater is when your entire closet begins to smell like popcorn, and the movie snack you once loved, begins to haunt you in your sleep. However, I am a huge movie enthusiast, and working at the theater is probably the most fun you can have through high school; Free movies and popcorn makes for cheap dates with the ladies. I worked my way up from tearing tickets to Assistant Manager. along the way I picked up quite a bit of professional skills, such as hiring and training staff, ordering and recieving stock, monitoring work practices, and scheduling movie rosters.
